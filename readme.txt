Pretty happy with the bid mathing on this one.
Currency is not deducted from the users account before tranaction is completed.
User will always get the lowest price, and uncompleted orders will keep searching for matching bids untill the whole order is completed.

--Userguide--
1. First create a new user.
2. Login with the user.
3. Push the order button to move to the users personal order screen where the user can place new bids.
4. Test to place overlapping bids and see how the engine is handeling overlappig bids
